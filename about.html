For a Lab Project, he designed a Motor Speed Control for an Electric Car. Since then, he always wanted one. In about 1984, when the first EV was produced by GM, called the EV-1, he called the R&amp;D Group in Detroit and asked to buy an EV-1 off the assembly line. Back then he was making about $24K a year, gross pay. The R&amp;D Group quoted the price of $120K. Gross adjusted dollars, present value, that is the same as asking $500K for the EV-1 now. One of the earliest EV meetings was held in the newly constructed Richardson Square Mall, in the Community Room, hosted by Paul Schaffer. Those were our humble beginnings as a group.
